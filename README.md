# ISQS5381_SUMMER2019_CAPSTONE_PROJECT
This is our capstone project for Texas Tech University Data Science program. Our objective in this study was to apply Data Mining techniques in Sport domain, particularly the most well-known basketball league - National Basketball Association (NBA). As a team sport, there are different factors, more than just individual statistics (e.g. team chemistry, managers’ tactics,...) contributing to the teams’ success on- and off- the court, but our study focused solely on individual performance with the objective of assisting team managements to predict players’ performances and evaluate players’ popularity using some popular Machine Learning algorithms.
