This is our capstone project for Data Science program. In this analysis, I used Python codes to collect and clean the data and R codes to develop models to predict players’ future performance through WinShare indicator.  
One benefit of these predictions is to improve teams’ decision making in recruitment process. As a team sport, there are many factors, more than just individual statistics (e.g. team chemistry, managers’ tactics) contributing to the teams’ success on the court. However, in our study, we limit our analysis in term of individual player only with the objective of assisting team managements to estimate players’ performances next season. In addition, through predicting players’ future performances, team managements and players’ agencies would negotiate and decide the most suitable players’ salaries, which constitute more than 50% of teams’ expenditure (https://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/21/nba-teams-revenue-spending-breakdown-small-large-market).  
We hope the results of this project can provide useful suggestion for NBA stakeholders in both on- and off- the court.
